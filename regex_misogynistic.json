{"id":28,"title":"Hidden Figures: Sarah Boone #BlackHERstoryMonth 6\/28","description":"Sarah Boone (1832-1904) was an African American inventor who on April 26, 1892, obtained United States patent rights for her improvements to the ironing board. Boone's ironing board was designed to improve the quality of ironing sleeves and the bodies of women's garments. The board was very narrow, curved, and made of wood. The shape and structure allowed it to fit a sleeve and it was reversible, so one could iron both sides of the sleeve.\n\nBoone was born Sarah Marshall in Craven County, North Carolina, near the town of New Bern in February 1832. On November 25, 1847, in New Bern, she married a freedman named James Boone (or Boon); they would have eight children. The Boone family left North Carolina for New Haven, Connecticut, before the outbreak of the American Civil War; they settled into a house at 30 Winter Street. James Boone worked as a brick mason until his death in 1874 while his wife was listed in New Haven directories as a dressmaker.\n\nShe filed her patent July 23, 1891, listing New Haven, Connecticut as her home. Her patent was published nine months later. Boone's patent was not the first for an ironing board, but ironing was usually done with irons heated on the stove or fire, using a table that was covered with a thick cloth. Often women would simply use the kitchen table, or prop a board on two chairs.\n\nSarah Boone patented an improvement to the ironing board (U.S. Patent #473,653) on April 26, 1892. Boone's ironing board was designed to be effective in ironing the sleeves and bodies of ladies' garments.\n\nBoone's board was very narrow and curved, the size and fit of a sleeve common in ladies' garments of that period. It was reversible, making it easy to iron both sides of a sleeve. She noted that the board could also be produced flat rather than curved, which might be better for the cut of the sleeves of men's' coats. She noted that her ironing board would also be well-suited for ironing curved waist seams.\n\nIn her patent application, she wrote that the purpose of her invention was \"to produce a cheap, simple, convenient and highly effective device, particularly adapted to be used in ironing the sleeves and bodies of ladies' garments.\u201d\n\nShe was one of the first black women to receive a patent in the United States, and she lived in New Haven for the rest of her life. Sarah Marshall Boone died in 1904 and is buried in a family plot in Evergreen Cemetery in New Haven.\n\n#SarahBoone #HiddenFigures\n\n******************\n\nMerchandise!

{"id":29,"title":"Hidden Figures: Georgia Gilmore","description":"Georgia Teresa Gilmore (February 5, 1920 \u2013 March 3, 1990) was an African American woman from Montgomery, Alabama, who participated in the Montgomery Bus Boycott through her fund-raising effort selling food at the boycott's mass meetings. Her grass-roots activism helped to sustain the long boycott and inspired similar groups to begin raising money.\n\nThough described as kind and motherly, Gilmore was also known for her fiery temper especially in response to the racial injustices so common in 1950s Alabama. She would resist discrimination on buses and even confronted white men in the community if they mistreated her or her family. Gilmore also worked at the National Lunch Company in Montgomery as a cook until the beginning of the bus boycott in late 1955.\n\nAfter Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to leave her seat on December 1, 1955, the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) declared a boycott of the bus system beginning on December 5. Gilmore, who had already refused to use the buses in Montgomery, heard of the arrest on the news and quickly joined the new Montgomery Improvement Association; this is when the boycott began. Gilmore's involvement in the boycott along with her vocal contempt for discriminatory white bus drivers resulted in her being fired from the National Lunch Company, but this only increased her participation within the MIA and the boycott later saying, \"this new generation had decided that they just had taken as much as they could.\" Following her dismissal from the Lunch Company, Martin Luther King, Jr. (who lived nearby) and other MIA leaders helped Gilmore set up her own restaurant in her home as a way for her to make a living. It was then that she began the boycott fund-raising effort which she called the Club from Nowhere.\n\nGeorgia Gilmore stated that \"what we could do best was cook\" and so began, with a group of friends, making sandwiches to sell at the mass meetings for the boycott and the MIA. The success of this venture led Gilmore and her friends to produce entire meals, including chicken dinners, cakes, and pies to sell to the boycotters. The money from these sales went towards helping the Montgomery Improvement Association and to sustain the boycott for as long as possible. Gilmore dubbed her group \"the Club from Nowhere\" to ensure the anonymity of the members as well as contributors (some of whom were white). In an effort to avoid any conflict, Gilmore established herself as the only officer in the Club from Nowhere; members gave her all the money they made, which she then passed to the leaders of the MIA at weekly mass meetings. The club soon began raising hundreds of dollars a week by selling their meals out of beauty parlors, Laundromats, and other locations frequented by both boycotters and supporters of the movement and would present their weekly gains at the meetings to the applause of the audience. Gilmore hoped that the success of the group had encouraged other \"ordinary folks\" to do the same. This organization and others like it are cited by some as what kept the boycott alive by providing money as well as grass-roots support within the community.\n\nGilmore and the Club from Nowhere show how the extensive efforts of African-American women aided and sustained the bus boycott, both in their financial contributions and in their commitment to the boycott itself. Her son Mark later stated that she had \"elevated her day-to-day work\u2014doing the cooking\u2014into something greater.\" In a 1986 interview, Gilmore credited African American women with being a driving force behind the boycott's success saying, \"you see they were maids, cooks. And they was the one that really and truly kept the bus running.\"\n\n#HiddenFigures #GeorgiaGilmore\n\n******************\n\nMerchandise!

A commenter asked me to make a video detailing my thoughts on rapper Azealia Banks most recent interview with magazine Pitchfork, where she called the music industry 'almost like slavery' and also shared her opinions on 'white girl rappers:'\n\n'Or it'll be like, \"We're gonna pop off the white-girl rapper\u2026\" The whole trend of white girls appropriating black culture was so corny... All the things I\u2019m trying to run away from in my black American experience are all the things that they\u2019re celebrating\u2026 if they fuckin\u2019 want them, have them; if they want to be considered oversexualized and ignorant every time they open their fucking mouth, then fucking take it... It\u2019s like, \u201cOh my God, you\u2019re doing this black woman impression, is that what the fuck you think of me, bitch? I need to meet the black woman that you\u2019re imitating because I\u2019ve never met any black woman who acts that bizarre.\u201d It\u2019s crazy that this becomes mainstream culture. All of America is celebrating shit like that. It\u2019s so weird.'\n\nI couldn't agree more with her sentiments. She makes great points about the commodification of culture as well as the way that cultural appropriation typically involves normalizing bizarre stereotypes and caricatures because there's a lack of genuine understanding about the culture being appropriated. This is one of the key differences between a culture being *appreciated* and being appropriated.\n\nHuge thumbs up to +Holla Black for suggesting this vid!

This is a quick video with my thoughts on the Columbus'ing of the term 'basic bitch' by white girls, who are loud, late, and wrong, as usual. white feminists have been mobilizing around the term and turning it into something it's not, which really doesn't bug me all that much because that's what they do and I don't think it's something to get up in arms over. A part of me wants to just laugh and say 'Stupid white girls,' but another part recognizes that there is no denying the problematic nature of co-opting Black language and turning it into slurs and misogynistic insults- which white folks have a habit of doing.\n\nSo yeah.

Regardless of all adversity, Meghan Trainor ultimately released a successful track which has a continuing popularity.\n\nSheet music: https:\/\/mnot.es\/2yJRMn7\n\nLyrics:\nBecause you know I'm all about that bass,\n'Bout that bass, no treble\nI'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble\nI'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble\nI'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass\n\nYeah it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two\nBut I can shake it, shake it like I'm supposed to do\n'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase\nAll the right junk in all the right places\nI see the magazines working that Photoshop\nWe know that shit ain't real\nCome on now, make it stop\nIf you got beauty beauty just raise 'em up\n'Cause every inch of you is perfect\nFrom the bottom to the top\nYeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size\nShe says, boys they like a little more booty to hold at night\nYou know I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll,\nSo, if that's what's you're into\nThen go ahead and move along\n\nBecause you know I'm all about that bass,\n'Bout that bass, no treble\nI'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble\nI'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble\nI'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass\n\nI'm bringing booty back\nGo ahead and tell them skinny bitches Hey\nNo, I'm just playing I know you think you're fat,\nBut I'm here to tell you that,\nEvery inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top\nYeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size\nShe says, boys they like a little more booty to hold at night\nYou know I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll,\n\nSo, if that's what's you're into\nThen go ahead and move along\n\nBecause you know I'm all about that bass,\n'Bout that bass, no treble\nI'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble\nI'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble\nI'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass\n\nBecause you know I'm all about that bass,\n'Bout that bass, no treble\nI'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble\nI'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble\nI'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass\n\nBecause you know I'm all about that bass,\n'Bout that bass, no treble\nI'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble\nI'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble\nI'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass\n\nSongwriters: Kevin Kadish \/ Meghan Trainor\nAll About That Bass lyrics \u00a9 Sony\/ATV Music Publishing LLC."}

I as I often do got out of my car and asked her if she had any children with her as she was parked in a child space. she said \"no, and what\" Instead of making an excuse or apologizing.\nAnnoyed I asked her if she would mind \"hurrying up and pissing off as those of us with kids would like to use the space.

{"id":52,"title":"My reaction seeing my bride for the first time!","description":"SUBSCRIBE for your daily dose of amazing videos!: http:\/\/bit.ly\/Newsflare\n\nAs a groom the reaction seeing your wife walk towards you in her wedding dress is a moment you will always cherish. The anticipation, excitement, and awe that consumes you causes such an uproar of emotions. The emotions I felt couldn't be contained and were NOT expected haha. The moment I laid my eyes on my wife shook me to the core. It was the first time I had seen my wife that day I had merely spoken to her. The emotion began when our wedding planner and photographer brought me the gift my wife had gotten for me. As I opened it it was a journal and a letter. I was instructed to open the letter first and to soak in all she had written. The letter stated that it was to her future husband and inside the letter was a level of intimacy people dream of. Written were her hopes and dreams she would find in a husband along with questions wondering what I would be like and if I would consistently pursue the Lord to find her. At the end of the letter my cheeks wet with tears, I noticed the letter was written in February of 2009, two years before I met Katie. Receiving a gift like that truly began the wildfire of emotions I felt that day and how special and cherished I felt. I didnt think my love for her could grow any stronger than it was but seeing her walk towards me, exchanging our vows, partaking in communion, and washing her feet brought me to such a level with her I feel like a dream. I'm so thankful someone captured that moment because we had absolutely no idea it was happening. I was focused on her and she was focused on me it was just happenstance that the beauty of God's love was captured in a little under two minutes.\n\n\nNewsflare has an eager team of people searching the web for top video content to share, we also take submissions from those looking to make sure their videos get seen by many plus earn some money back.

{"id":71,"title":"A visit to Elmhurst's Crescent Park neighborhood","description":"http:\/\/gracikmakinneygroup.com\/\n\nYesterday I visited two homes in the Crescent Park subdivision in Elmhurst with Tom Makinney and Maria Gracik of Koenig & Strey's Gracik Makinney Group. We were shooting sponsored videos, which will be live at YouTube within a few days.\n\nThe homes, at 350 E Ridge Ave, priced at $439,000, and 511 S Parkview Ave, priced at $1,299,000, illustrate the range of options in Crescent Park. The Ridge home will be open this Sunday, September 18, from 2 to 4 p.m.\n\nThe Crescent Park neighborhood is bounded on the west by Poplar Ave, on the north by St Charles Rd, on the east by I-290 and on the south by the Illinois Prairie Path. A small triangular park, Crescent Park, is at the center of the neighborhood, which has gently curving streets lined with mature trees and a slightly sloping topography. Wild Meadows Park and Washington Park lie along the southern and eastern edges of the area.\n\nAccording to the Elmhurst Historical Museum, Crescent Park was originally a 128-acre farm and was once platted as a cemetery before being sold to a developer who envisioned it as the \"most exclusive residence district\" in Chicago's western suburbs.\n\nToday, says Tom Makinney, whose wife grew up in Crescent Park, it's \"one of the top three subdivisions in Elmhurst.\" In the video we stand in Washington Park as Makinney outlines the reasons for his conclusion."}

{"id":77,"title":"Average Cost Perpetual Inventory Method","description":"This video shows how to use the average cost method to calculate Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and ending inventory for a company that uses a perpetual inventory system.\n\nCompanies that use a perpetual inventory system update the inventory account whenever inventory is purchased or sold.  Thus, a company using LIFO and a perpetual system would not wait until the end of the period before adjusting the inventory account or recording Cost of Goods Sold; instead, it would record a journal entry to reflect the change in inventory whenever a transaction involving inventory occurs.  Whenever inventory is sold, the company would calculate the average cost of the inventory on hand as of that date in time (this includes purchases up until that point in the period, plus any beginning inventory) and multiply this by the number of units sold to obtain the Cost of Goods Sold for that transaction (this goes on the Income Statement).  If inventory is sold again later in that same period, the company must calculate another average cost that will be used to calculate the Cost of Goods Sold to be recognized on that transaction.  Because the average cost is being re-calculated and is different for each transaction, this method is often referred to as a moving average.\n\nEdspira is your source for business and financial education.\nTo view the entire video library for free, visit http:\/\/www.Edspira.com\n\nTo like Edspira on Facebook, visit https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Edspira\n\nTo sign up for the newsletter, visit http:\/\/Edspira.com\/register-for-newsletter\n\nEdspira is the creation of Michael McLaughlin, who went from teenage homelessness to a PhD.
