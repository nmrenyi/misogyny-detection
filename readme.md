# Misogyny Detection

## Definition of misogyny (Prompt to LLM)

Misogyny is hatred of, contempt for, or prejudice against women or girls. It is a form of sexism that can keep women at a lower social status than men, thus maintaining the social roles of patriarchy.

Here are some typical misogynistic behaviours:

Objectifying women. 
Belittling women or girls in conversation, such as using sexist nicknames or using derogatory remarks.  
Seeking to control women’s behaviour. 
Using intimidating or humiliating behaviour to destroy a woman’s self-confidence and undermine her. 
Discriminating against women, for example a woman is not offered a job that she is qualified for because she is a woman or it is assumed that a woman can’t do something because she is a woman. 
Having double standards where men are viewed in a lenient way and women tend to be criticised.
Treating women differently from men in social and professional settings. 
Threatening, aggressive, intimidating, or violent behaviour.
Pursuing unwanted sexual comments or advances, including catcalling, stalking, staring, touching, taking pictures without consent, exposure to sexual assault and rape.
Controlling, confident and self-centred behaviour, as well as competitive.

Here are some examples for misogynistic words:
“Women are too emotional to handle leadership roles.”
“She got that job only because she’s attractive.”
“A woman’s place is in the kitchen, not in the boardroom.”
“She should stop worrying about her career and focus on getting married.”
“Men are naturally better at science and math than women.”
“If she dresses like that, she’s just asking for attention.”
“Women are terrible drivers compared to men.”
“Girls are too sensitive; they just can’t handle criticism.”
“You’re not like other girls; you’re smart and capable.”
“Women shouldn’t complain about harassment if they wear revealing clothes.”
