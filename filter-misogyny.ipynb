We were shooting sponsored videos, which will be live at YouTube within a few days.\\n\\nThe homes, at 350 E Ridge Ave, priced at $439,000, and 511 S Parkview Ave, priced at $1,299,000, illustrate the range of options in Crescent Park. The Ridge home will be open this Sunday, September 18, from 2 to 4 p.m.\\n\\nThe Crescent Park neighborhood is bounded on the west by Poplar Ave, on the north by St Charles Rd, on the east by I-290 and on the south by the Illinois Prairie Path. A small triangular park, Crescent Park, is at the center of the neighborhood, which has gently curving streets lined with mature trees and a slightly sloping topography. Wild Meadows Park and Washington Park lie along the southern and eastern edges of the area.\\n\\nAccording to the Elmhurst Historical Museum, Crescent Park was originally a 128-acre farm and was once platted as a cemetery before being sold to a developer who envisioned it as the \"most exclusive residence district\" in Chicago's western suburbs.\\n\\nToday, says Tom Makinney, whose wife grew up in Crescent Park, it's \"one of the top three subdivisions in Elmhurst.\" In the video we stand in Washington Park as Makinney outlines the reasons for his conclusion.</td>\n",

We were shooting sponsored videos, which will be live at YouTube within a few days.\\n\\nThe homes, at 350 E Ridge Ave, priced at $439,000, and 511 S Parkview Ave, priced at $1,299,000, illustrate the range of options in Crescent Park. The Ridge home will be open this Sunday, September 18, from 2 to 4 p.m.\\n\\nThe Crescent Park neighborhood is bounded on the west by Poplar Ave, on the north by St Charles Rd, on the east by I-290 and on the south by the Illinois Prairie Path. A small triangular park, Crescent Park, is at the center of the neighborhood, which has gently curving streets lined with mature trees and a slightly sloping topography. Wild Meadows Park and Washington Park lie along the southern and eastern edges of the area.\\n\\nAccording to the Elmhurst Historical Museum, Crescent Park was originally a 128-acre farm and was once platted as a cemetery before being sold to a developer who envisioned it as the \"most exclusive residence district\" in Chicago's western suburbs.\\n\\nToday, says Tom Makinney, whose wife grew up in Crescent Park, it's \"one of the top three subdivisions in Elmhurst.\" In the video we stand in Washington Park as Makinney outlines the reasons for his conclusion.  \n",

The story was barely covered by major news outlets, not only due to the fact that it was a sexual assault case rather than a case of Black murder or protest, but also due to the fact that all 13 of Holtzclaw's victims were Black women who he thought 'no one would believe.' Black people on social media keep this case alive.\\n\\nWe don't need them. All we need is ourselves and each other.\\nBlack critics, Black storytellers, Black social media... We can control our narrative. Especially when we see how MSM twists and warps narratives when they cover a story at all.\\n\\nWe have the power. We are powerful. We are strong.\\nWe don't have to keep trying to insert ourselves into mainstream white spaces.\\n\\nThanks for watching.\\n\\nLinks:\\n\\n'How did Daniel Holtzclaw get away with it for so long?
